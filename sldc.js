// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

// PADIT-M

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";

const analysisOfRequirements =
  "The second step is considered part of planning and determines what is required to happen to be able to accomplish the goal of the software. Hiring more devs, building larger computer base are two examples.";

const design =
  "Big picture view of the way a software application will work. Aspects such as architecture, UI, platforms, programming language, and security measures are all topics to be considered.";

const implement =
  "The actual writing of the code by devs, and making sure it runs. Smaller projects might be written by a single dev, while larger projects might be broken up and worked by several teams.";

const testAndIntegrate =
  "The testing is critical before making it available to users to ensure each function works correctly. Leads to higher user satisfaction and better usage rate. QA team.";

const maintain =
  "The software will require regular maintenance, as updates in the tech world happen all the time. In this step we're maintaining that the code will work for customers as its supposed to.";
